## ❓ Problem Statement
FedEx currently manages overdue accounts through manual, siloed processes (emails/spreadsheets), leading to:
* **"Black Box" Operations:** Minimal visibility into DCA (Debt Collection Agency) agent behavior.
* **Weak Governance:** Lack of audit trails for interaction compliance.
* **Inefficiency:** Slow feedback loops and delayed recovery cycles exceeding 25 days.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Sentinel provides a single, AI-driven platform that automates the end-to-end debt recovery process.
* **Intelligent Ingestion:** Single repository for case data via CSV or ERP sync, eliminating silos.
* **Propensity Prioritization:** AI scores payment likelihood to focus efforts on high-value accounts.
* **Automated Compliance:** NLP-based monitoring ensures ethical collections and immediate breach alerts.

---

## ✨ Key Features
* **🧠 AI Scoring Engine:** Utilizes Scikit-learn for Propensity-to-Pay and Complexity scoring.
* **⚖️ Meritocratic Allocation:** Auto-assigns cases to DCAs based on performance leaderboards and SLA capacity.
* **🕵️ AI Sentinel Auditor:** Continuous real-time NLP monitoring for policy compliance and sentiment analysis.
* **📊 Tri-Party Portals:** Specialized interfaces for FedEx Managers, DCA Agents, and Strategic Management.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS (Deployed as a Progressive Web App).
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js with JWT-based Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
* **AI & Intelligence:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLP (BERT), and LangChain (Master-Agent architecture).
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Financials/Audit) and MongoDB (Unstructured Interaction Logs).
* **Integration:** Future RPA interface for SAP/Oracle synchronization.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
Sentinel follows a **three-tier, deployment-ready native architecture**.

1.  **Access Layer:** Dedicated portals for clients, managers, and DCA partners.
2.  **Orchestration Layer:** Node.js backend managing data streams and SLA rules.
3.  **Intelligence Layer:** Python-based AI agents for scoring and sentiment auditing.

## 📈 Economic Impact
| Metric | Pre-Sentinel (Manual) | Post-Sentinel (AI-Driven) | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recovery Rate** | ~45%  | **60–75%**  | Higher Liquidity |
| **Allocation Time** | 1–2 Days | **<5 Minutes** | Reduced Labor Costs |
| **Audit Coverage** | <20% (Sample) | **100% (Real-time)** | Risk Mitigation |
| **Case Cycle Time** | 25+ Days | **12–15 Days** | Optimized Efficiency |
